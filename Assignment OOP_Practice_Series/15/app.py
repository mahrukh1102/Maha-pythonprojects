# 15. Method Resolution Order (MRO) and Diamond Inheritance
# Assignment:
# Create four classes:

# A with a method show(),

# B and C that inherit from A and override show(),

# D that inherits from both B and C.

# Create an object of D and call show() to observe MRO.


class A:
    def show(self):
        print("A")

class B(A):
    def show(self):
        print("B")
        super().show()

class C(A):
    def show(self):
        print("C")
        super().show()    

class D(B, C):
    pass

d = D()
d.show()

print(D.mro())
